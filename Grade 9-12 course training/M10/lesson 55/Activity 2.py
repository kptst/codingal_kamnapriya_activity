For function1, the Algorithm goes like this:

 

(4*5) / 2

 

So, the number of iterations will be 1.

 

For function2 the Algorithm goes like:

 

1 + 2 + 3 + 4

 

So, number of iterations will be 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

 

For function3 the Algorithm goes like:

 

1 + (1+1) + (1+1+1) + (1+1+1+1)

 

So, number of iterations will be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

 

So for our functions 1,2 and 3, the number of iterations will depend upon n (4 in our case):

Fun1 : \(C1\)
Fun2 : \(C2(n) + C3\)
Fun3: \(C4(n^{2}) + C5(n) + C6\)
 

The above conversions are known as the Asymptomatic analysis of the algorithm.

 

Comparison between function1 and function2 :
